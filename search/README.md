In Computer Science, the search algorithms are designed to solve [search problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_problem) with more efficiency, search algorithms generally work with [discrete variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_or_discrete_variable), but in advanced search algorithms is possible working with continuous variables.
